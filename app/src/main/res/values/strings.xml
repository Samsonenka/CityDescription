            Warsaw is the official capital of Poland, the largest city in this country,
            which for many centuries has occupied a dominant position in its political and
            cultural arena. Once one of the most beautiful cities in Eastern Europe, Warsaw was
            catastrophically severely destroyed during the occupation by Hitlers troops.
            Despite the fact that many monuments and structures of medieval Warsaw were restored,
            most of the city was rebuilt in a modern style. Mirrored skyscrapers, busy streets and
            neighborhoods contrast sharply with the quiet streets and low houses of the Old Town.
